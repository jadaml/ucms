Micro Content Management System (µCMS) is a lightweight CMS software, which allow users to provide the content in Markdown files. The hierarchy of the pages are defined by the file hierarchy the markdown files are placed, and every page is queried with GET requests, thus eliminating the need to maintain a database on the host.

Originally I have created µCMS as a practice to learn PHP in the early 2000s, I have released it as a means to quickly create a CMS website, without much knowledge on building one. Although it is severely inadequate compared to other modern solution, this project remains only as an option to those, who wants to deepen their web server management skill, by introducing a tool that does not provide much help in maintaining the site for them. As technologically it is severely limited, and hence it is called micro-CMS.

When referring to µCMS in a context, where only ASCII characters are available, you may refer to this software as either mCMS or uCMS—though I personally don't like the typesetting of 'µ' as 'u' despite the project package name uses it.
